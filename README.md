# Polymath Studio Keyboard/Trackball Combo

## Description

A keyboard and trackball in one, for efficient computer usage.

Like the [PS-OHK](https://github.com/blueOkiris/ps-ohk/), the PS-KTC attempts to provide an efficiently laid out keyboard which doesn't require moving your hands back and forth from the mouse.

Unlike the PS-OHK, it accomplishes this while allowing for typing quickly via using both hands. This is done by placing a trackball in the middle of the keyboard!

## Layout

Like the PS-OHK, the PS-KTC uses a custom keyboard layout designed around placing commonly used characters right on the home row followed by similar sounds being near each other. It also aims to be roughly a 100% keyboard, although a few shortcuts are taken.

Layout:

```

    Lft Dwn Rt  Alt Ret Cmp               -----     
```

Where the home row is S, T, I, A, Space, Trackball, E, R, O, N

There are 80 keys here. Why not 100? Well, there are few reasons:

1. Due to the every key being available and close to a finger in this arrangement, there is no need for the 10 num-pad digits nor the Num Lock nor the num-pad duplicates of /, \*, -, +, Return, and \./Delete. That's 100 - 10 - 7 = 83
2. No Print Screen, Scroll Lock, or Pause because, let's be real, the vast majority of people, myself included, do not need these keys. Maybe Print Screen, but Super + Shift + S is a great key combo for screenshot, so Print Screen is not needed. That's 83 - 3 = 80 keys
